# Batteread

This code can be used to read some status data over bluetooth from the BMS of a LiFePo4 battery manufactured by [Li-gen](https://www.li-gen.net/) and sold around the year 2022. I am unsure what the make and model of the BMS hardware is but the bluetooth interface identifies it's manufacturer ar SKYLAB.

Use this code at your own risk!! For all I know, using this library with a different BMS might permantly damage it, possibly causing a fire or explosion.
